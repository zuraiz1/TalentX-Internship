# Overview

What this system does is check PIA's live flight schedule and send a Discord alert the moment a flight becomes delayed or cancelled.
It runs entirely on GitHub - no server, laptop, or manual restarting required. Once set up, it checks in automatically 5 times a day and only messages you when something actually changes.

# How to use

Firstly, Unzip the "Flight\_watch.zip", [set up](#set-up) the system. Once set up, it runs itself - there are no daily steps.

## Tips

* To test it immediately instead of waiting for the schedule, go to the repo's **Actions** tab → **PIA Flight Watch** → **Run workflow**.
* If Discord alerts stop arriving, check the latest run's logs in the **Actions** tab first - most issues show up clearly there (missing secret, bad webhook, AirLabs error).
* If you ever change what's monitored (e.g. specific airports instead of all PIA flights), edit `WATCH\_FILTERS` in `pia\_flight\_watch.py` - but keep it to **one filter**, since each filter costs one AirLabs request and the daily budget is only 5.
* `flight\_state.db` is what stops you from getting the same alert twice. If alerts seem "stuck" or wrong, you can safely delete it from the repo - it will just get recreated fresh on the next run.

# Set up

To set it up, you need a GitHub repo, an AirLabs account, and a Discord server you can add webhooks to.

|Step|What to do|
|-|-|
|1. Create the repo|Push all project files to a new GitHub repo (private is fine). Keep the folder structure exactly as-is, including `.github/workflows/flight\_watch.yml`.|
|2. Get an AirLabs API key|Sign up at [airlabs.co](https://airlabs.co), copy your API key from the dashboard.|
|3. Get a Discord webhook URL|In Discord: **Server Settings → Integrations → Webhooks → New Webhook**, pick the channel, copy the URL.|
|4. Add both as GitHub Secrets|Repo → **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret**. Add `AIRLABS\_API\_KEY` and `DISCORD\_WEBHOOK\_URL` (names must match exactly).|
|5. Test it|**Actions** tab → **PIA Flight Watch** → **Run workflow**. Check the logs for errors, and check Discord if any PIA flight happens to be delayed/cancelled at that moment.|
|6. Done|The schedule in `flight\_watch.yml` takes over from here - 5 automatic runs a day.|

## Local testing (optional)

If you want to run the script on your own machine before pushing to GitHub:

1. Copy `config.txt.example` to `config.txt`.
2. Fill in your real `AIRLABS\_API\_KEY` and `DISCORD\_WEBHOOK\_URL`.
3. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`, then `python3 pia\_flight\_watch.py`.
4. `config.txt` is git-ignored, so this never risks leaking your keys.
